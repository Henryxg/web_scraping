14,Naia P7 pool suite luxury portugal rep Salvador,"My b/f and I stayed for 2.5 days after visiting the Galapagos islands. For the price of the apt, it was a good deal - clean, good wifi, and in a great location. However, it's a little bare bones, i.e. no paper towels, limited toilet paper, and no potable drinking water, etc. so for a longer stay you will probably want to head over to Mega Maxi (close by) to buy some essentials. We didn't use the common areas in the building but the doormen were always pleasant and helpful.",2022-07-01

Loved to sit on the balcony and watch the life on the street.  Recommendations for local bars and restaurants were perfect.  Try the yucca chica at Soreno Moreno or the pizza at Bandido Brewery.  Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.  So read and think hard about whether this place is right for you.  None of it was an issue for me and was super happy here, but I could see where some items could be an issue for others.",2022-09-01

The apartment was cozy, modern, well-equipped, and perfect for my stay. Excellent location a couple blocks from my lawyer's office and with many restaurants and supermarket (megamaxi) in walking distance, right near Carolina park where I went for a nice jog. Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

111,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB! It is the top  of the homes I've enjoyed here. Excellent location and value for the rate.

148,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.  So read and think hard about whether this place is right for you.  None of it was an issue for me and was super happy here, but I could see where some items could be an issue for others.",2022-09-01

Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

342,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

He offered to help me get from the airport to the apartment, responded quickly to all my inquiries, and helped me out with any missing items that I needed in the house. I felt very safe and comfortable at Carlos's place. The only tiny comment I would make is to clean the kitchen a little bit more for guests who plan to stay longer.

402,Beautiful room at an unbeatable price.,"It's a place near to almost everything, clean as you see in the picture. The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

452,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

456,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

466,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
467,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi.

Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

492,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01
493,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Great apartment in the center of town. Close to bars, shops and restaurants. Just FYI for future travelers the apartment is on the top floor and there is no elevator if you have heavy suitcase it will be a pain going up the stairs. Also the shower is an electric shower it provides medium hot water, but if you are expecting a hot shower it's not gonna happen. Otherwise the apartment is big spacious and in a great location.",2022-05-01

496,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"The host was very helpful when we arrived late and the building was locked. There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

556,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
557,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
558,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

Loved to sit on the balcony and watch the life on the street.  Recommendations for local bars and restaurants were perfect.  Try the yucca chica at Soreno Moreno or the pizza at Bandido Brewery.  Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.  So read and think hard about whether this place is right for you.  None of it was an issue for me and was super happy here, but I could see where some items could be an issue for others.",2022-09-01

The building is conveniently located and so close to good restaurants, cafes, drugstore and ATMs. I also appreciate the security and the lovely souls working at the reception and outside. Currently, there are some construction work going on in the neighbourhood. I would still recommend this place if you are out early and come back by 5pm.

638,Modern Suite in the Most Vibrant Place in Quito!,"I booked with Galo for a week of business in Quito after looking at many other listings. The apartment was cozy, modern, well-equipped, and perfect for my stay. Excellent location a couple blocks from my lawyer's office and with many restaurants and supermarket (megamaxi) in walking distance, right near Carolina park where I went for a nice jog. Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

724,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

881,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

918,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there. But all in all for the price and the service you get which includes breakfast it's excellent.",2022-03-01

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

1028,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

1032,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

1042,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
1043,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

1068,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

1132,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
1133,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
1134,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

1399,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB! It is the top  of the homes I've enjoyed here. Excellent location and value for the rate. This will be my home in Quito, especially for long-term stays!𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗩𝗘𝗟 & 𝗪𝗢𝗥𝗞 Life WellBeyond 50 • Live An InspiringLocation Independent Life!𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗡𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗱𝘀 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝟱𝟬 ",2022-08-01

1436,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

1622,Spectacular Apartment L View WiFi Cable TV 505,I was in Quito visiting for business and Dorys was an amazing host. From the time I arrived until the time I left she was very attentive and responded immediately to any questions and requests I had. The place was very comfortable and the bed was especially comfy. I typically have trouble sleeping in the high altitude but the bed was so inviting I had no problems falling asleep each night. The place was very clean and had all the amenities I needed during my stay. There was a guard that was available 24/7 which was super helpful and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. I would definitely come back and stay with Dorys again. She absolutely made my stay worthwhile. Thank you Dorys!,2022-10-01

1630,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

I felt very safe and comfortable at Carlos's place. The only tiny comment I would make is to clean the kitchen a little bit more for guests who plan to stay longer.

The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

1744,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

1754,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
1755,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

1780,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

1844,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
1845,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01

I typically have trouble sleeping in the high altitude but the bed was so inviting I had no problems falling asleep each night. The place was very clean and had all the amenities I needed during my stay. There was a guard that was available 24/7 which was super helpful and I felt very safe in the neighborhood. I would definitely come back and stay with Dorys again. She absolutely made my stay worthwhile. Thank you Dorys!,2022-10-01

2012,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

2206,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

He offered to help me get from the airport to the apartment, responded quickly to all my inquiries, and helped me out with any missing items that I needed in the house. I felt very safe and comfortable at Carlos's place. The only tiny comment I would make is to clean the kitchen a little bit more for guests who plan to stay longer. Some of the dishes and kitchenware were a bit dirty. But other than that, I 100% recommend staying here and will plan on doing so again next time Im in Quito.",2022-08-01

The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

2316,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

2320,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

2330,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01

Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

2356,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

2420,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
2421,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
2422,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

The kitchen was equipped enough for most simple meals, the beds are comfortable and it has warm showers.Marlen is an incredibly generous host, she treated us like family for the time we were there.

Lots of cheap eating options nearby since there’s a university in the area catering to students. Marlen and her father were extremely gracious hosts offering us fresh fruit from the gardens as well as other foods and beer throughout our stay.

2687,Best area in Ibarra,"Español:Este es un Airbnb maravilloso, la hospitalidad de los anfitriones es increíble. La casa es preciosa. Me quedé un mes solo y el espacio era todo lo que necesitaba. Yo diría que podría ser demasiado pequeño para una familia más grande que para los padres y 2 hijos, pero fue perfecto para mí. El espacio es precioso. La casa está a unos 30 minutos a pie del centro de la ciudad o a poca distancia en coche. Creo que las vistas de las montañas son magníficas y el maravilloso mantenimiento del jardín hace que siempre haya colibríes durante todo el día. Sobre todo, este es un lugar increíble para quedarse. Supongo que mi única desventaja sería que el baño es un poco pequeño y tienes que ser muy conservador con el agua caliente mientras te duchas. ¡Además de eso, definitivamente un Airbnb 10/10! Muy recomendable.English:This is a wonderful Airbnb the hospitality of the hosts are amazing. The home is beautiful. Stayed for a month all by myself and the space was all I needed. I would say it might be too small for a family larger then parents and 2 children but it was perfect for me. The space is beautiful. The house is like a 30 minute walk away from the city center or a short drive. I think the views of the mountains are magnificent and the wonderful upkeep of the garden makes it so there are always humming birds throughout the day. Over all this is an amazing place to stay. I guess my only con would be that the bathroom is a little bit small and you have to be very conservative with the hot water while showering. Besides that definitely a 10/10 Airbnb! Highly recommended.",2021-12-01

2693,Your home in the center of Ibarra,"Roberto's apartment is a huge, well-equipped property in the HEART of downtown Ibarra. The location is awesome and the size of the space was more than enough for my 4-person family. Other reviewers have talked about the noise factor with the property being located just above a major city thoroughfare. It's an honest factor, but wasn't prohibitive for me and my family given our needs and the many other pros that are on the table (value, location, mega space). Roberto is an excellent host. He was very responsive and flexible. Counting the number of plates, cups, and bowls at check in might be annoying if not offensive to responsible and experienced Airbnb guests. A guest manual (or simple write-up) with the WiFi code and other essential instructions might make for a more efficient check in and help the guest feel like a trusted member of the Airbnb community. Overall, it was an enjoyable stay.",2021-12-01

Very secure with security door separating the businesses from the apartment.  Aura lives across the hall and is an attentive host. We arrived on Sunday evening and the storefront was closed. The entrance from the sidewalk was a low door inside of the pull-down security panel. It was a little tricky to find when closed up so you will know what to look for if you arrive after business hours. Aura greeted us once we found the door. Great value with all you need for a pleasant stay!",2018-06-01

I would stay again, but not through Airbnb and not if I wanted any help or directions, the address is even wrong on the map function.

Loved to sit on the balcony and watch the life on the street.  Recommendations for local bars and restaurants were perfect.  Try the yucca chica at Soreno Moreno or the pizza at Bandido Brewery.  Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.  So read and think hard about whether this place is right for you.  None of it was an issue for me and was super happy here, but I could see where some items could be an issue for others.",2022-09-01

Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

2888,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

3082,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

3142,Beautiful room at an unbeatable price.,"It's a place near to almost everything, clean as you see in the picture. The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

3192,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

3196,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

3206,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
3207,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

3232,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

3296,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
3297,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
3298,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

However, it's a little bare bones, i.e. no paper towels, limited toilet paper, and no potable drinking water, etc. so for a longer stay you will probably want to head over to Mega Maxi (close by) to buy some essentials.

The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

3464,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

3658,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

3767,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Great place in downtown Ambato. We stayed for one night before proceeding to Baños. The apartment has all the amenities you need and you have many shops and food places to pick from.,2022-08-01
3768,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01
3769,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"Very spacious, comfortable unit with rooftop access with a nice view of the mountains. Laundry and Hot tub for a fee and very centrally located. Thin windows were the only downside due to an alarm going off for hours one night.",2021-09-01

3772,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

3782,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
3783,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

3808,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01
3809,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Great apartment in the center of town. Close to bars, shops and restaurants. Just FYI for future travelers the apartment is on the top floor and there is no elevator if you have heavy suitcase it will be a pain going up the stairs. Also the shower is an electric shower it provides medium hot water, but if you are expecting a hot shower it's not gonna happen.

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

3872,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
3873,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01

4175,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,Todo ok,2022-07-01
4176,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

4284,Modern Suite in the Most Vibrant Place in Quito!,"I booked with Galo for a week of business in Quito after looking at many other listings. The apartment was cozy, modern, well-equipped, and perfect for my stay. Excellent location a couple blocks from my lawyer's office and with many restaurants and supermarket (megamaxi) in walking distance, right near Carolina park where I went for a nice jog. Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

4370,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

I felt very safe and comfortable at Carlos's place. The only tiny comment I would make is to clean the kitchen a little bit more for guests who plan to stay longer.

The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

4480,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

4484,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

4494,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01

4520,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

4584,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
4585,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
4586,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.  So read and think hard about whether this place is right for you.  None of it was an issue for me and was super happy here, but I could see where some items could be an issue for others.",2022-09-01

4666,Modern Suite in the Most Vibrant Place in Quito!,"I booked with Galo for a week of business in Quito after looking at many other listings. The apartment was cozy, modern, well-equipped, and perfect for my stay. Excellent location a couple blocks from my lawyer's office and with many restaurants and supermarket (megamaxi) in walking distance, right near Carolina park where I went for a nice jog. Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

4752,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

4909,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

4946,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

5056,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

5060,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

5070,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
5071,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

5096,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

5160,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
5161,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01

It's close enough to the city and Otavalo if you want to do some tourism but away from the craziness. Perfect retreat! Hans was super accommodating and an overall joy. The place looks exactly like the photos. There are some mosquitoes at night but not too bad. We live on the coast so we're used to a lot more. It's a bit chilly at night but also tolerable.

The kitchen was equipped enough for most simple meals, the beds are comfortable and it has warm showers.Marlen is an incredibly generous host, she treated us like family for the time we were there.

Lots of fruit trees and it feels like an oasis just on the edge of the city. Location is great. We were close to epic mountain biking and sight seeing yet still close to the city. Lots of cheap eating options nearby since there’s a university in the area catering to students. Marlen and her father were extremely gracious hosts offering us fresh fruit from the gardens as well as other foods and beer throughout our stay.

5427,Best area in Ibarra,"Español:Este es un Airbnb maravilloso, la hospitalidad de los anfitriones es increíble. La casa es preciosa. Me quedé un mes solo y el espacio era todo lo que necesitaba. Yo diría que podría ser demasiado pequeño para una familia más grande que para los padres y 2 hijos, pero fue perfecto para mí. El espacio es precioso. La casa está a unos 30 minutos a pie del centro de la ciudad o a poca distancia en coche. Creo que las vistas de las montañas son magníficas y el maravilloso mantenimiento del jardín hace que siempre haya colibríes durante todo el día. Sobre todo, este es un lugar increíble para quedarse. Supongo que mi única desventaja sería que el baño es un poco pequeño y tienes que ser muy conservador con el agua caliente mientras te duchas. ¡Además de eso, definitivamente un Airbnb 10/10! Muy recomendable.English:This is a wonderful Airbnb the hospitality of the hosts are amazing. The home is beautiful. Stayed for a month all by myself and the space was all I needed. I would say it might be too small for a family larger then parents and 2 children but it was perfect for me. The space is beautiful. The house is like a 30 minute walk away from the city center or a short drive. I think the views of the mountains are magnificent and the wonderful upkeep of the garden makes it so there are always humming birds throughout the day. Over all this is an amazing place to stay. I guess my only con would be that the bathroom is a little bit small and you have to be very conservative with the hot water while showering. Besides that definitely a 10/10 Airbnb!

The location is awesome and the size of the space was more than enough for my 4-person family. Other reviewers have talked about the noise factor with the property being located just above a major city thoroughfare. It's an honest factor, but wasn't prohibitive for me and my family given our needs and the many other pros that are on the table (value, location, mega space). Roberto is an excellent host. He was very responsive and flexible. Counting the number of plates, cups, and bowls at check in might be annoying if not offensive to responsible and experienced Airbnb guests. A guest manual (or simple write-up) with the WiFi code and other essential instructions might make for a more efficient check in and help the guest feel like a trusted member of the Airbnb community.

5474,"Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra","Sofi's place is in a prime location for proximity to historic central Ibarra. It is an easy walk to restaurants, the Centro Cultural El Cuartel and the city parques. The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a storefront building (mostly medical and dental offices) and is accessed through a  main corridor. Very secure with security door separating the businesses from the apartment.  Aura lives across the hall and is an attentive host. We arrived on Sunday evening and the storefront was closed. The entrance from the sidewalk was a low door inside of the pull-down security panel. It was a little tricky to find when closed up so you will know what to look for if you arrive after business hours. Aura greeted us once we found the door. Great value with all you need for a pleasant stay!",2018-06-01
5475,"Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra","Not meant for Airbnb, but a great place to stay in Ibarra. It doesn't feel like an Airbnb, but more so a hotel apartment. Sofi wasn't around nor did she ever respond to me, only Aura. The communication face to face was great, but my messsages and questions asked via Airbnb were never answered. I would stay again, but not through Airbnb and not if I wanted any help or directions, the address is even wrong on the map function. Very sweet lady and genuine, I believe the method of how Airbnb works is just lost in communication. Clean and just as seen in pics!",2017-10-01

Check-in and communication were also great, we always got a direct response and found everything right away. If you are good on foot, it is easy to walk from the terminal, even with luggage. Less than 2 minutes away there is a supermarket, a really good ice cream shop and restaurants. In addition, there are 2 parks nearby and there are many small shops, cafes and co. A great place to stay for those who want to get to know Ibarra.",2022-05-01

Unfortunately the kitchen was not cleaned properly and there’s no drinking water provided. The kitchen is barely stocked enough to make a meal for your family.If you have any issues, the hotel can’t help with anything that’s inside the apartment so you’re left with communicating with the host. He or she was somewhat willing to try and fix the tvs as neither were working but the problem wasn’t fixed. I let them know the coffee maker didn’t work and there was no response. And there was absolutely no more communication from them for our whole stay after the first night and we were there 3 nights.

When we got there we noticed the owner had left HALF a roll of toilet paper in one of the bathrooms, and nothing in the second bathroom. When we called the reception, they said we had to contact the owner. Knowing we had already tried reaching him with no response, we asked the hotel to send up some toilet paper that we would pay for it. They said they would but no one ever came.

5626,VISTA AL MAR & BARBACOA & PISCINA & MEJOR UBICACION,"This was good value considering what else there is to offer in the area, but expect a 3 star stay.  The photos may be a bit better than what is there.  The place in reasonably comfortable, but a little worn around the edges and could use some TLC.  Garage parking was one of the only ways in or out, since keys are not available for the front gate.  There's a buzzer/doorbell there, but it is not always answered.  It was high tide near the ocean wall much of the time we were here, so not much of a beach close by.  There are some nice restaurants, coffee and ice cream shops close by, but the area is half developed, with several empty lots and half finished construction projects between this place and the water - meaning not much of a view.   The Pacific Mall near the Malecón is about 20-25 minutes walk and the Malecón is about 5-10 minutes past that. If you simply need a place to stay and know how to get around Manta, or how to get to other towns nearby, this place is fine.",2022-01-01

Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.

5699,Modern Suite in the Most Vibrant Place in Quito!,"I booked with Galo for a week of business in Quito after looking at many other listings. The apartment was cozy, modern, well-equipped, and perfect for my stay. Excellent location a couple blocks from my lawyer's office and with many restaurants and supermarket (megamaxi) in walking distance, right near Carolina park where I went for a nice jog. Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

5785,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

5942,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

5979,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

6089,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

6093,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

6103,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
6104,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

6129,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

6193,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
6194,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
6195,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

6324,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

6361,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

6554,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,Todo ok,2022-07-01
6555,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

6669,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

6679,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
6680,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

6705,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01
6706,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Great apartment in the center of town. Close to bars, shops and restaurants. Just FYI for future travelers the apartment is on the top floor and there is no elevator if you have heavy suitcase it will be a pain going up the stairs. Also the shower is an electric shower it provides medium hot water, but if you are expecting a hot shower it's not gonna happen.

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

6769,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
6770,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01

The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

7073,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

7267,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

I felt very safe and comfortable at Carlos's place. The only tiny comment I would make is to clean the kitchen a little bit more for guests who plan to stay longer. Some of the dishes and kitchenware were a bit dirty. But other than that, I 100% recommend staying here and will plan on doing so again next time Im in Quito.",2022-08-01

The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

7377,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

7381,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

7391,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01

Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

7417,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

7481,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
7482,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
7483,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

However, it's a little bare bones, i.e. no paper towels, limited toilet paper, and no potable drinking water, etc. so for a longer stay you will probably want to head over to Mega Maxi (close by) to buy some essentials.

Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.

Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

7649,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

7806,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB! It is the top  of the homes I've enjoyed here. Excellent location and value for the rate. This will be my home in Quito, especially for long-term stays!𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗩𝗘𝗟 & 𝗪𝗢𝗥𝗞 Life WellBeyond 50 • Live An InspiringLocation Independent Life!𝗗𝗶𝗴𝗶𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗡𝗼𝗺𝗮𝗱𝘀 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝟱𝟬 ",2022-08-01

7843,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

I only booked this place for 2 nights, however I took a taxi very early in the morning of my departure day, since I couldn’t wait to leave. Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”. Condominium means to me, much, much more than what this place is . My taxi driver had an enormous difficulty to find the location.",2022-09-01

7953,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

7957,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

7967,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
7968,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

7993,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

8057,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
8058,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01

We are traveling cross country and to Colombia and wanted a quiet place near beautiful scenery before making our way to Colombia. This was exactly what we wanted and the place exceeded our expectations! The lake is beautiful and very kid friendly, also great for biking. It's close enough to the city and Otavalo if you want to do some tourism but away from the craziness. Perfect retreat! Hans was super accommodating and an overall joy. The place looks exactly like the photos. There are some mosquitoes at night but not too bad. We live on the coast so we're used to a lot more. It's a bit chilly at night but also tolerable. The sun shined bright the next morning though. He also has a great restaurant and brewery on-site. We hope to be back one day!!",2022-10-01

In the end we were sad to have to leave!They have a beautiful place, with amazing views over the lake, gardens filled with different fruit trees with walking paths and places to relax and enjoy the surroundings. The kitchen was equipped enough for most simple meals, the beds are comfortable and it has warm showers.Marlen is an incredibly generous host, she treated us like family for the time we were there. We were given lemons, oranges and avocados from the garden, homemade cakes and rides into the centre in exchange for helping to pick lemons, and were even invited to tea on the terrace.",2022-06-01

Incredible place to end an amazing day in Ibarra no matter what you end up doing. Loved the big spacious living area and Marlens property is gorgeous. Lots of fruit trees and it feels like an oasis just on the edge of the city. Location is great. We were close to epic mountain biking and sight seeing yet still close to the city. Lots of cheap eating options nearby since there’s a university in the area catering to students. Marlen and her father were extremely gracious hosts offering us fresh fruit from the gardens as well as other foods and beer throughout our stay. Very friendly people!The only thing to be prepared for is the kitchen is bare bones. Just enough cutlery and pans for basic meals. Other than that it is a perfect place to stay.

8324,Best area in Ibarra,"Español:Este es un Airbnb maravilloso, la hospitalidad de los anfitriones es increíble. La casa es preciosa. Me quedé un mes solo y el espacio era todo lo que necesitaba. Yo diría que podría ser demasiado pequeño para una familia más grande que para los padres y 2 hijos, pero fue perfecto para mí. El espacio es precioso. La casa está a unos 30 minutos a pie del centro de la ciudad o a poca distancia en coche. Creo que las vistas de las montañas son magníficas y el maravilloso mantenimiento del jardín hace que siempre haya colibríes durante todo el día. Sobre todo, este es un lugar increíble para quedarse. Supongo que mi única desventaja sería que el baño es un poco pequeño y tienes que ser muy conservador con el agua caliente mientras te duchas. ¡Además de eso, definitivamente un Airbnb 10/10! Muy recomendable.English:This is a wonderful Airbnb the hospitality of the hosts are amazing. The home is beautiful. Stayed for a month all by myself and the space was all I needed. I would say it might be too small for a family larger then parents and 2 children but it was perfect for me. The space is beautiful. The house is like a 30 minute walk away from the city center or a short drive. I think the views of the mountains are magnificent and the wonderful upkeep of the garden makes it so there are always humming birds throughout the day. Over all this is an amazing place to stay. I guess my only con would be that the bathroom is a little bit small and you have to be very conservative with the hot water while showering. Besides that definitely a 10/10 Airbnb!

8330,Your home in the center of Ibarra,"Roberto's apartment is a huge, well-equipped property in the HEART of downtown Ibarra. The location is awesome and the size of the space was more than enough for my 4-person family. Other reviewers have talked about the noise factor with the property being located just above a major city thoroughfare. It's an honest factor, but wasn't prohibitive for me and my family given our needs and the many other pros that are on the table (value, location, mega space). Roberto is an excellent host. He was very responsive and flexible. Counting the number of plates, cups, and bowls at check in might be annoying if not offensive to responsible and experienced Airbnb guests. A guest manual (or simple write-up) with the WiFi code and other essential instructions might make for a more efficient check in and help the guest feel like a trusted member of the Airbnb community.

8371,"Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra","Sofi's place is in a prime location for proximity to historic central Ibarra. It is an easy walk to restaurants, the Centro Cultural El Cuartel and the city parques. The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a storefront building (mostly medical and dental offices) and is accessed through a  main corridor. Very secure with security door separating the businesses from the apartment.  Aura lives across the hall and is an attentive host. We arrived on Sunday evening and the storefront was closed. The entrance from the sidewalk was a low door inside of the pull-down security panel. It was a little tricky to find when closed up so you will know what to look for if you arrive after business hours. Aura greeted us once we found the door. Great value with all you need for a pleasant stay!",2018-06-01
8372,"Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra","Not meant for Airbnb, but a great place to stay in Ibarra. It doesn't feel like an Airbnb, but more so a hotel apartment. Sofi wasn't around nor did she ever respond to me, only Aura. The communication face to face was great, but my messsages and questions asked via Airbnb were never answered. I would stay again, but not through Airbnb and not if I wanted any help or directions, the address is even wrong on the map function. Very sweet lady and genuine, I believe the method of how Airbnb works is just lost in communication. Clean and just as seen in pics!",2017-10-01

Check-in and communication were also great, we always got a direct response and found everything right away. If you are good on foot, it is easy to walk from the terminal, even with luggage. Less than 2 minutes away there is a supermarket, a really good ice cream shop and restaurants. In addition, there are 2 parks nearby and there are many small shops, cafes and co. A great place to stay for those who want to get to know Ibarra.",2022-05-01

It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

8525,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

8719,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

8828,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Great place in downtown Ambato. We stayed for one night before proceeding to Baños. The apartment has all the amenities you need and you have many shops and food places to pick from.,2022-08-01
8829,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01
8830,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"Very spacious, comfortable unit with rooftop access with a nice view of the mountains. Laundry and Hot tub for a fee and very centrally located. Thin windows were the only downside due to an alarm going off for hours one night.",2021-09-01

8833,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

8843,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
8844,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

8869,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01
8870,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Great apartment in the center of town. Close to bars, shops and restaurants. Just FYI for future travelers the apartment is on the top floor and there is no elevator if you have heavy suitcase it will be a pain going up the stairs. Also the shower is an electric shower it provides medium hot water, but if you are expecting a hot shower it's not gonna happen.

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

8933,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
8934,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01

9101,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

9197,Unique Experience Design Loft: A forest,"I absolutely loved my stay here. The fact that the hosts designed and implemented this absolute marvel of a space is unbelievable in itself.

Loved to sit on the balcony and watch the life on the street.  Recommendations for local bars and restaurants were perfect.  Try the yucca chica at Soreno Moreno or the pizza at Bandido Brewery.  Enjoy the cafes and plazas in the afternoon in the historic center.I would say that a lot of the things mentioned in the comments here are true - street noise or being on third floor of a walk up, for example.  So read and think hard about whether this place is right for you.  None of it was an issue for me and was super happy here, but I could see where some items could be an issue for others.",2022-09-01

Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs.

9295,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

I felt very safe and comfortable at Carlos's place. The only tiny comment I would make is to clean the kitchen a little bit more for guests who plan to stay longer.

9355,Beautiful room at an unbeatable price.,"It's a place near to almost everything, clean as you see in the picture. The rooms are comfortable, the place is safe since the door to the reception need a code to enter so only the person incharge can allow people in and out, the suit also uses a card to go in and out, if you hate taking the stairs there is an elevator which is 24/7, it has a window with a  beautiful view. I love Netflix but the room has other Tv connections except Netflix that was my only disappointment, faster internet which was ok for my classes, hot water but takes longer to heat up, There is a tub as shown in the picture but unfortunately can't be used since the closing and opening lid is not there.

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

9405,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

9409,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

9419,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01

9445,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01
9446,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Great apartment in the center of town. Close to bars, shops and restaurants. Just FYI for future travelers the apartment is on the top floor and there is no elevator if you have heavy suitcase it will be a pain going up the stairs. Also the shower is an electric shower it provides medium hot water, but if you are expecting a hot shower it's not gonna happen. Otherwise the apartment is big spacious and in a great location.",2022-05-01

9449,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"The host was very helpful when we arrived late and the building was locked. There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

9509,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
9510,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
9511,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

9727,Modern Suite in the Most Vibrant Place in Quito!,"I booked with Galo for a week of business in Quito after looking at many other listings. The apartment was cozy, modern, well-equipped, and perfect for my stay. Excellent location a couple blocks from my lawyer's office and with many restaurants and supermarket (megamaxi) in walking distance, right near Carolina park where I went for a nice jog. Building security was very kind, always saying hello, and they were helpful in greeting me and giving me the keys to check in. The space was very clean, and I was comfortable to hang out in the cozy living room watching youtube and netflix on the nice big TV. The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all. The one issue I had was the washing machine not drying my clothes thoroughly, and this was easily solved by air-drying the rest... also Galo responded immediately and said he would get it fixed, and in the meantime he even offered to pay for my laundry service at the laundromat downstairs. Super service, and super happy with the value I received overall. Would definitely stay again.",2022-10-01

It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

9813,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

9970,Great apartment next to the Carolina park,"I specifically focused on the neighborhood surrounding Parque La Carolina because I lived here for 13 months during the first year of the pandemic.It is safe, with convenient access to many shops, restaurants, and services. It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

10007,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

Place was clean, however the furniture and the whole place needs to be updated. Even tough this place is advertised as a “Condominium”, the street sign reads as “ Galapagos Apartments”.

10117,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01

10121,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

10131,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
10132,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

10157,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants.

10221,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
10222,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01
10223,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",Great little cabin located up in the hills.  I only spent one night here but it was great.  the power is solar with batteries so you can charge your electronics no problem.

However, it's a little bare bones, i.e. no paper towels, limited toilet paper, and no potable drinking water, etc. so for a longer stay you will probably want to head over to Mega Maxi (close by) to buy some essentials.

The bedroom had a great desk space with lamp, big comfy bed, and was about as quiet as one could hope for in the city. Wifi was solid throughout. No complaints at all.

It's also just a short Uber ride to Quito's historical center and other sights.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘𝗗• This is a remarkably quiet  neighborhood surrounded by a lively part of the city; especially peaceful considering the proximity to Parque La Carolina (3 min. walk) and all the services that are within easy access.• The building is fairly new, modern; nice and secure with key fob required for entry and to operate the elevators.• 24/7 security is standard for this area of Quito; however, the guards here are very helpful and attentive.• The apartment is lovely, quiet, and super clean with a nice urban view from the balcony.• Spacious bathroom and closet with lots of drawers, hangers, and rods. • Well equipped kitchen... with an OVEN, not just a cooktop! Although I didn't use it during my short 2-week stay, this is rare in most new Quito apartments; it's nice to have for a long-term rental.• YAH ! There is a space HEATER. YES ! The nights are cool/cold here, 365 DAYS OF. THE. YEAR. Haha! This is the first place I have stayed in Quito that has one and it is a welcomed --almost essential-- luxury. • Internet speed is fast and the service was consistent with very few disconnects.• Communication with the host was excellent; Diego was very responsive to my questions.𝗪𝗛𝗔𝗧 𝗜 𝗗𝗜𝗗𝗡'𝗧 𝗟𝗜𝗞𝗘• There really is nothing significant that I didn't like about this stay. 𝗕𝗢𝗧𝗧𝗢𝗠 𝗟𝗜𝗡𝗘... I highly recommend this AirBnB!

10389,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

However, it's a little bare bones, i.e. no paper towels, limited toilet paper, and no potable drinking water, etc. so for a longer stay you will probably want to head over to Mega Maxi (close by) to buy some essentials. We didn't use the common areas in the building but the doormen were always pleasant and helpful.",2022-07-01

10583,Modern Luxury Studio Apartment Downtown,"We had a great stay and this location is perfect for all things and excursions located around Quito. With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar. Again, a great location with tons of restaurants around and a quick uber/taxi to most local museums and the airport(~45 min).",2022-06-01

10692,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Great place in downtown Ambato. We stayed for one night before proceeding to Baños. The apartment has all the amenities you need and you have many shops and food places to pick from.,2022-08-01
10693,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,Carlos place was great I got it very last minute the only thing that sucks it’s on the 4th floor and with luggage you’re going to get a workout in. Other than that it was mostly clean just old trash in the bathroom but the kid took it out and leftover clothes in the dresser. Netflix was slow but I’ve noticed it’s like that in most places in South America. Internet can be faster if anything but It’s right in the downtown close to everything,2021-11-01
10694,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"Very spacious, comfortable unit with rooftop access with a nice view of the mountains. Laundry and Hot tub for a fee and very centrally located. Thin windows were the only downside due to an alarm going off for hours one night.",2021-09-01

10697,Modern Apartment 3Hab #4 City Center,"First, safety and communication is first and foremost, and this was not the case. The price was not the apt for what I saw and the nearby places neither. I think they need to detail more so that the people who rent have no problems. In addition, the co-host had to call him more than 10 times and a lady answered me, first I was sent a 10-year-old or 12-year-old to give me the keys, I asked to be sent to an adult and in the end a 19-year-old person came who turned my eyes to indicate all the mishaps we had. In the description they indicate that there is a garage, which there is no. And I was sent to look for one nearby that was an additional $3.00 .. The host scoffed at me because I told him it was a 19-year-old . I don't think her attitude was adequate and she also lives in another country and it's obvious that she couldn't fix it. We asked for the refund and he declined to return it even though there is an aircover and he told me that this does not apply to him. Terrible would NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.",2022-10-01

10707,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"First things first, pictures do NOT do this place justice! This stay is 10x better than we expected and we had high expectations! The fridge was stocked with wine, drinks and snacks (of note, let Cristian know what you had so he can charge you for use, still very reasonable). There were so many beautiful fish in the tanks, we were able to use the projector and the bed was so comfy it was hard to leave in the morning! We met his adorable dog Negra, and his family welcomed us into their private home to spend quality time together which was so much fun even with the language barrier! Cristian is also an amazing artist and creator, take a peek inside his small store and if you have a chance go to the main one he has near the house. He gave us very clear instructions, the only door on the street with many colors (he was not kidding! So cool!) and his family was there to greet us at the door and welcome us inside. It is in a perfect location where taxis are readily available but not too loud where it is difficult to sleep. His mother provided us with plenty of extra blankets and a duvet in case we were cold overnight, so sweet!Only challenge was getting the hot water in the jacuzzi to work. Perhaps instructions regarding how to work the jacuzzi would be best for those looking to use it. Otherwise this stay completely exceeded our expectations. We highly highly recommend staying here if you can. We were here for Carnaval and it was the perfect location.",2022-02-01
10708,Cosmos Chill. Suite with Jacuzzi and aquarium.,"The place looks super great. Nice hot shower with pressure, also enough hot water for the jacuzzi. Wifi wasn’t that great at the beginning, but they fixed it. Room is big. Projector is fine, but the remote control didn’t work great, so I decided to connected my laptop with the projector, which worked perfectly. The only downside is the loud noice from the water flowing into the aquarium. However, the host mentioned he’ll change it. Communication was nice. They helped us when we had questions.",2021-10-01

10733,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Because of the Paro I was forced to stay in Ambato super last second. I made the booking and arrived at the location as soon as I was accepted so I can understand the place not being cleaned up by the time I got there. Juan assured me if we went out to eat (we were starving and needed some groceries as well) the house would be cleaned while we were gone. Unfortunately, it wasnt cleaned up while we were gone but the lady arrived as we were waiting around in the living room. She did a great job, although I did have to request for her to change the sheets but I'm pretty sure it was the same blankets. So that threw me off but the location is perfect and Juan is very responsive to any issues you may have. There was a usable bathroom, a usable kitchen, and the wifi worked so I can't complain. The floor does creak a lot and the airbnb is located all the way at the top for those with mobility issues. Thank you for everything Juan!",2022-06-01
10734,Departamento Centro AMBATO,"Great apartment in the center of town. Close to bars, shops and restaurants. Just FYI for future travelers the apartment is on the top floor and there is no elevator if you have heavy suitcase it will be a pain going up the stairs. Also the shower is an electric shower it provides medium hot water, but if you are expecting a hot shower it's not gonna happen.

There was no lock-box for the keys, which would've been easier but we were able to find wifi at the nearby library to call him. He was also very accommodating when our plans changed and we needed to leave a few  days early. The apartment itself has the basics (and lots of fun pop-art) so it has the feel of a youth hostel. The internet is slow if you're doing anything more than email and the floors are very squeaky (walking to the bathroom during the night wakes everyone else up), but the location is very close to the park, cathedral, shopping, and restaurants. Overall it's a good value if you need an inexpensive place in Ambato.",2022-01-01

10797,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.",I had an amazing time in the cabin. The view is so impressive then the pictures on Airbnb show and its a great place to relax and disconnect from the busy world outside. The cabin is spacious and has all the facilities you need. It also has huge windows so you are able to enjoy the view to a maximum. The internet is good enough for remote working (video and audio calls) but don't expect the fastest speed ever. Don't forget to get some groceries before arrival because without a taxi to pick you up it's roughly 60 min to the supermarket in Patate. You can also ask Carlos to arrange a taxi which is roughly $5 and takes you directly into town in 20 min. It's definitely my nr. 1 place I have slept so far in Ecuador. Truly an amazing experience.,2022-08-01
10798,"bear cabin, sweet home in the mountains.","Talk about a beautiful house! Wonderful views of the mountains and stars at night (Being from the US, we were quite excited to have a wonderful view of the Southern Cross). It is a bit hard to find, but our host was wonderfully patient and helpful and eventually found us when we couldn't find him. Be aware that you do need to drive a quarter mile or so down a gravel road, but if you've been driving long in Ecuador without minding the potholes and speed bumps you should be fine. Be sure and bring warm clothes, there is a fireplace and propane heater that take the edge off, but it can still be awfully chilly in the morning. Definitely worth the detour from the main roads, I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a place to stay in the area.",2022-08-01

Apparently it no longer takes eight hours to get through the customs.Oh, as for the lodgings, his advert on Airbnb was telling the truth. I didn't find any false claims.",2019-07-01

We are traveling cross country and to Colombia and wanted a quiet place near beautiful scenery before making our way to Colombia. This was exactly what we wanted and the place exceeded our expectations! The lake is beautiful and very kid friendly, also great for biking. It's close enough to the city and Otavalo if you want to do some tourism but away from the craziness. Perfect retreat! Hans was super accommodating and an overall joy. The place looks exactly like the photos. There are some mosquitoes at night but not too bad. We live on the coast so we're used to a lot more. It's a bit chilly at night but also tolerable. The sun shined bright the next morning though. He also has a great restaurant and brewery on-site. We hope to be back one day!!",2022-10-01

We were in Ibarra for a week and a half because all the roads were closed due to rioting. Marlen let us stay as long as we needed. In the end we were sad to have to leave!They have a beautiful place, with amazing views over the lake, gardens filled with different fruit trees with walking paths and places to relax and enjoy the surroundings. The kitchen was equipped enough for most simple meals, the beds are comfortable and it has warm showers.Marlen is an incredibly generous host, she treated us like family for the time we were there. We were given lemons, oranges and avocados from the garden, homemade cakes and rides into the centre in exchange for helping to pick lemons, and were even invited to tea on the terrace.",2022-06-01

Lots of fruit trees and it feels like an oasis just on the edge of the city. Location is great. We were close to epic mountain biking and sight seeing yet still close to the city. Lots of cheap eating options nearby since there’s a university in the area catering to students. Marlen and her father were extremely gracious hosts offering us fresh fruit from the gardens as well as other foods and beer throughout our stay. Very friendly people!The only thing to be prepared for is the kitchen is bare bones. Just enough cutlery and pans for basic meals. Other than that it is a perfect place to stay.

11064,Best area in Ibarra,"Español:Este es un Airbnb maravilloso, la hospitalidad de los anfitriones es increíble. La casa es preciosa. Me quedé un mes solo y el espacio era todo lo que necesitaba. Yo diría que podría ser demasiado pequeño para una familia más grande que para los padres y 2 hijos, pero fue perfecto para mí. El espacio es precioso. La casa está a unos 30 minutos a pie del centro de la ciudad o a poca distancia en coche. Creo que las vistas de las montañas son magníficas y el maravilloso mantenimiento del jardín hace que siempre haya colibríes durante todo el día. Sobre todo, este es un lugar increíble para quedarse. Supongo que mi única desventaja sería que el baño es un poco pequeño y tienes que ser muy conservador con el agua caliente mientras te duchas. ¡Además de eso, definitivamente un Airbnb 10/10! Muy recomendable.English:This is a wonderful Airbnb the hospitality of the hosts are amazing. The home is beautiful. Stayed for a month all by myself and the space was all I needed. I would say it might be too small for a family larger then parents and 2 children but it was perfect for me. The space is beautiful. The house is like a 30 minute walk away from the city center or a short drive. I think the views of the mountains are magnificent and the wonderful upkeep of the garden makes it so there are always humming birds throughout the day. Over all this is an amazing place to stay. I guess my only con would be that the bathroom is a little bit small and you have to be very conservative with the hot water while showering. Besides that definitely a 10/10 Airbnb!

The location is awesome and the size of the space was more than enough for my 4-person family. Other reviewers have talked about the noise factor with the property being located just above a major city thoroughfare. It's an honest factor, but wasn't prohibitive for me and my family given our needs and the many other pros that are on the table (value, location, mega space). Roberto is an excellent host. He was very responsive and flexible. Counting the number of plates, cups, and bowls at check in might be annoying if not offensive to responsible and experienced Airbnb guests. A guest manual (or simple write-up) with the WiFi code and other essential instructions might make for a more efficient check in and help the guest feel like a trusted member of the Airbnb community.

11111,"Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra","Sofi's place is in a prime location for proximity to historic central Ibarra. It is an easy walk to restaurants, the Centro Cultural El Cuartel and the city parques. The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a storefront building (mostly medical and dental offices) and is accessed through a  main corridor. Very secure with security door separating the businesses from the apartment.  Aura lives across the hall and is an attentive host. We arrived on Sunday evening and the storefront was closed. The entrance from the sidewalk was a low door inside of the pull-down security panel. It was a little tricky to find when closed up so you will know what to look for if you arrive after business hours. Aura greeted us once we found the door. Great value with all you need for a pleasant stay!",2018-06-01
11112,"Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra","Not meant for Airbnb, but a great place to stay in Ibarra. It doesn't feel like an Airbnb, but more so a hotel apartment. Sofi wasn't around nor did she ever respond to me, only Aura. The communication face to face was great, but my messsages and questions asked via Airbnb were never answered. I would stay again, but not through Airbnb and not if I wanted any help or directions, the address is even wrong on the map function. Very sweet lady and genuine, I believe the method of how Airbnb works is just lost in communication. Clean and just as seen in pics!",2017-10-01
11113,"Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra","A totally cool apartment in a really great area! The apartment itself was very clean and we didn't miss anything at all. Check-in and communication were also great, we always got a direct response and found everything right away. If you are good on foot, it is easy to walk from the terminal, even with luggage. Less than 2 minutes away there is a supermarket, a really good ice cream shop and restaurants. In addition, there are 2 parks nearby and there are many small shops, cafes and co. A great place to stay for those who want to get to know Ibarra.",2022-05-01

Unfortunately the kitchen was not cleaned properly and there’s no drinking water provided. The kitchen is barely stocked enough to make a meal for your family.If you have any issues, the hotel can’t help with anything that’s inside the apartment so you’re left with communicating with the host. He or she was somewhat willing to try and fix the tvs as neither were working but the problem wasn’t fixed. I let them know the coffee maker didn’t work and there was no response. And there was absolutely no more communication from them for our whole stay after the first night and we were there 3 nights.

When we got there we noticed the owner had left HALF a roll of toilet paper in one of the bathrooms, and nothing in the second bathroom. When we called the reception, they said we had to contact the owner. Knowing we had already tried reaching him with no response, we asked the hotel to send up some toilet paper that we would pay for it. They said they would but no one ever came.

11263,VISTA AL MAR & BARBACOA & PISCINA & MEJOR UBICACION,"This was good value considering what else there is to offer in the area, but expect a 3 star stay.  The photos may be a bit better than what is there.  The place in reasonably comfortable, but a little worn around the edges and could use some TLC.  Garage parking was one of the only ways in or out, since keys are not available for the front gate.  There's a buzzer/doorbell there, but it is not always answered.  It was high tide near the ocean wall much of the time we were here, so not much of a beach close by.  There are some nice restaurants, coffee and ice cream shops close by, but the area is half developed, with several empty lots and half finished construction projects between this place and the water - meaning not much of a view.   The Pacific Mall near the Malecón is about 20-25 minutes walk and the Malecón is about 5-10 minutes past that. If you simply need a place to stay and know how to get around Manta, or how to get to other towns nearby, this place is fine.",2022-01-01

11355,Small Room w/bathroom 6min walk from Airport,"Close to the airport and nice that the bathroom is in your room. Bad: if you copy the listed address into Google maps it brings up the wrong place…make sure you open the address link directly from Airbnb. Also apparently taxis have no idea where this place is and I had to direct mine. Luckily I figured out I was in the wrong place on my own because I couldn’t get a hold of the host at the time even though she knew my arrival time. The room didn’t seem ready for me (no toilet paper or sheet/blanket) and while the room was clean the rest of the house was a mess. The bathroom wall is open at the ceiling to the rest of the house which means there was lots of noise that came right in  and made it hard to sleep until 12:30 AM (eg people talking, street noise, doors opening/closing). I couldn’t leave for 10 minutes in the morning because you need a key to be let out and initially I couldn’t get a hold of the hosts.",2022-07-01

Check in wasn't flawless and had to contact the host multiple times and speak to reception about my reservation. It took about 30 minutes to get the key that was left there but they couldn't find. I have stayed in the building in another apartment and both are not as clean as they say. The AC never cooled the apartment after multiple tries and speaking to host. We just ended up opening the windows and let the fresh air come in. The location is great for tourist but unfortunately the apartment is a bit beat up.
