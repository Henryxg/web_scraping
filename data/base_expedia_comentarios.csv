The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out.

The breakfast was good. The water was hot enough to shower comfortably after a wait to get warm. The wifi was pretty reliable.  The staff was generally friendly and tried to be helpful. Water dispensers were available in the lobby and on our floor. 
The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out. When I checked out there was no mention of it. I assume that it was because the hotel is new to Expedia. See more",3.0,2017-02-22

*Clean, economical rooms
*Beer, bottled drinks, wine, even massages in house that you can purchase onsite
*the most helpful staff ever...booked tours for us for way cheaper than we could find on our own, English speaking, and consistently went above and beyond. Helped us avoid missing our flight by explaining the am bus schedule and that we wouldn’t make it to Quito in time. Then she booked a taxi for us (our only option as we had to leave at 3am) and GOT UP AT 3 AM to escort us to the taxi!
*very delicious breakfast that changes everyday. You even have the option to add to it for additional cost. Great, friendly cook.
*Cheap laundry service!

1151,Hostal Riviera Sucre,"Excellent We were only supposed to stay in Otavalo for one night, but a mishap with not getting our rental car forced us to change our plans drastically and we ended up staying here for 4 nights. We were honestly very happy that it happened.
The hostel is very well taken care of. The owner does speak English, the rest of the staff speaks little but they were all very helpful and attentive.
Breakfast each morning was bread/butter/jam, juice, eggs and coffee. The location is great, very close to the town square and the daily markets. The garden area inside was gorgeous. We were even able to have our laundry done. The owner also has a trusted contact for longer drives outside of the city if needed. We utilized this for an afternoon hike and a visit to Cotocachi (which is a must if you are in this area).

The in-house restaurant is excellent with a variety of dishes for most any taste including delicious thin-crust pizzas cooked in a wood-fired oven. The breakfast is excellent and includes tasty coffee or a variety of teas. Filtered water awaits you in your room when you arrive, so there is no need to run out to fill your water bottle after a long day. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice clean rooms.

The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party.

The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out.

But if you are looking for a quiet, safe, convenient, and friendly hotel, I definitely recommend Sheraton. I think Sheraton did basic systems much better than other hotels. I believe the good things are not visible, but you can feel them. The room is quiet, and the clothes dry fast...all these mean the construction team might add enough insulation for each demising wall and exterior so I can feel a comfortable environment.

1700,Park Inn by Radisson Quito,"Terrible Premises are decently okay.   This is small Hotel that I don't understand how they received the Radisson Certification.     Staff is definitely the best asset in this Hotel... but,

Location is definitely the problem that is NOT disclose properly.    Hotel is located in the Main Avenue of a RED ZONE; - full of Crime (we spent one night that couldn't sleep), across the street was a Club with people partying all night long; - Noise was unbearable; - Police and Ambulances were active due of the Street fights 

We stayed at the room 1002 (10th floor) and we still can hear the activity happening at the surrounding

Simply dissatisfied and disappointed !!!

To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party.

Water dispensers were available in the lobby and on our floor. 
The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out.

There's an excellent staff, a tasty restaurant on site, and many things to do if your decide to hang out on the grounds.  It was a very romantic setting with incredible attention to detail. The gardens are amazing. The room was comfortable. They built a fire each night in our room and provided cool hot water bottles to go under the blankets at night, though we never found it particularly cold when we went in October.

But seriously, with Cerro Imbabura rising majestically on one side, and the tranquil waters of Lago San Pablo on the other, it's hard to ask for more. Just don't get too worried as you drive through a very common Ecuadorian neighborhood on the way there. You may think, ""where am I going?""

On arrival to our Hotel we was greeted by English speaking staff and given a free upgrade. 
When it comes to customer service I can’t remember staying anywhere better, staff are very attentive and genuinely concerned our stay in their hotel was what we expected. 
If Spanish speaking staff did not understand what we wanted either at front desk or in the restaurant they would go and get someone that spoke English to translate. 
Breakfast in hotel restaurant was very good, with a choice of about 6-7 different country style of breakfast. 
We had fruit, eggs and pancakes which was awesome and set you up for a good start to the day. 
Dinner menu also had a good choice and was very good quality food. 

Overall the hotel was very good in a great loacation and amazing staff who wanted us to have the best stay in their hotel.

2428,The Cottages by the sea,"Okay This was our first stop after flying to Manta on the coast of Ecuador.  It was right in the middle of the country's carnival which made the town very congested and noisy.  When we arrived and asked for confirmation of the free breakfast, we were told it wasn't included.  However, upon showing the written confirmation, the owner agreed.  Although they do not appear to be well set up for providing breakfasts, the staff did put together a good breakfast for us.  I think if we had purchased one of their larger rooms our experience might have been a lot better, but they were full on the night of arrival.  The room we had was very small, and although it had all the features mentioned below, it did not meet our needs so we left after the first night even though we were paid for three nights.  We drove to a different town with a nicer beach and stayed there for three nights.  Even though the new place cost a bit more and had none of the features listed below under ""...likes..."", we found it much better than Cottages by the Sea because it was spacious, airy, well-lit, modern, very clean, had lots of hooks & hangers and places to put our bags and things, had two multi-speed fans in each room and had an immaculate, bright bathroom with high-end fixtures.See more",3.0,2018-02-28

Water dispensers were available in the lobby and on our floor. 
The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out.

Water dispensers were available in the lobby and on our floor. 
The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out.

But if you are looking for a quiet, safe, convenient, and friendly hotel, I definitely recommend Sheraton. I think Sheraton did basic systems much better than other hotels. I believe the good things are not visible, but you can feel them. The room is quiet, and the clothes dry fast...all these mean the construction team might add enough insulation for each demising wall and exterior so I can feel a comfortable environment.

2953,Park Inn by Radisson Quito,"Terrible Premises are decently okay.   This is small Hotel that I don't understand how they received the Radisson Certification.     Staff is definitely the best asset in this Hotel... but,

Location is definitely the problem that is NOT disclose properly.    Hotel is located in the Main Avenue of a RED ZONE; - full of Crime (we spent one night that couldn't sleep), across the street was a Club with people partying all night long; - Noise was unbearable; - Police and Ambulances were active due of the Street fights 

We stayed at the room 1002 (10th floor) and we still can hear the activity happening at the surrounding

Simply dissatisfied and disappointed !!!

To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party.

Water dispensers were available in the lobby and on our floor. 
The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out.

There's an excellent staff, a tasty restaurant on site, and many things to do if your decide to hang out on the grounds.  It was a very romantic setting with incredible attention to detail. The gardens are amazing. The room was comfortable. They built a fire each night in our room and provided cool hot water bottles to go under the blankets at night, though we never found it particularly cold when we went in October.

But seriously, with Cerro Imbabura rising majestically on one side, and the tranquil waters of Lago San Pablo on the other, it's hard to ask for more.

*Clean, economical rooms
*Beer, bottled drinks, wine, even massages in house that you can purchase onsite
*the most helpful staff ever...booked tours for us for way cheaper than we could find on our own, English speaking, and consistently went above and beyond. Helped us avoid missing our flight by explaining the am bus schedule and that we wouldn’t make it to Quito in time. Then she booked a taxi for us (our only option as we had to leave at 3am) and GOT UP AT 3 AM to escort us to the taxi!
*very delicious breakfast that changes everyday. You even have the option to add to it for additional cost. Great, friendly cook.
*Cheap laundry service!

Water dispensers were available in the lobby and on our floor. 
The bad: our room was in the front of the hotel and it was loud even by Ecuadorian standards.  The noise culminated with the police using a loudspeaker to intervene in a domestic situation taking place across the street with a bullhorn at 0200. The beds gave new meaning to ""firm"".  It was like sleeping on a board with a blanket on top.  They were very uncomfortable.  The staff speaks very little English and with my limited Spanish, it was difficult at times.  To be fair, they were very patient and nice about my language shortcomings. There was a misunderstanding about the number of people in our party. There were 4 instead of the 2 listed on the reservation.  Someone spoke to the other people in the group about some additional charges but it was apparently straightened out.

4630,Hotel San Francisco de Quito,"Good The place is awesome. The location is incredible. And the hotel is in good shape. But the service was awful, they offer you a simple breakfast where you are not able to ask for something different than scramble eggs, not even sunny side of or a tortilla. The staff does not show the hotel around and they make it look as it is a place to crush. It is one of the most beautiful places to stay at the center of Quito. But all the crew do not care about it. They don’t even tell you what places can you visit or where to eat since they close their beautiful dinning room for the whole day. It is really sad to see a place with such an amazing potencial to be left like a place to only spend the night. See more",4.0,2022-09-05

But seriously, with Cerro Imbabura rising majestically on one side, and the tranquil waters of Lago San Pablo on the other, it's hard to ask for more.

The breakfast is excellent and includes tasty coffee or a variety of teas. Filtered water awaits you in your room when you arrive, so there is no need to run out to fill your water bottle after a long day. Friendly and helpful staff. Nice clean rooms.

But they are close enough to many other good places to eat, so it really wanst a big deal. I was still able to get a delicious Mojito with fresh mint from the garden. And when I was able to eat at the restaurant for Bfast, and 1 dinner the food was excellent.

On arrival to our Hotel we was greeted by English speaking staff and given a free upgrade. 
When it comes to customer service I can’t remember staying anywhere better, staff are very attentive and genuinely concerned our stay in their hotel was what we expected. 
If Spanish speaking staff did not understand what we wanted either at front desk or in the restaurant they would go and get someone that spoke English to translate. 
Breakfast in hotel restaurant was very good, with a choice of about 6-7 different country style of breakfast. 
We had fruit, eggs and pancakes which was awesome and set you up for a good start to the day. 
Dinner menu also had a good choice and was very good quality food.

However, upon showing the written confirmation, the owner agreed.  Although they do not appear to be well set up for providing breakfasts, the staff did put together a good breakfast for us.  I think if we had purchased one of their larger rooms our experience might have been a lot better, but they were full on the night of arrival.  The room we had was very small, and although it had all the features mentioned below, it did not meet our needs so we left after the first night even though we were paid for three nights.  We drove to a different town with a nicer beach and stayed there for three nights.  Even though the new place cost a bit more and had none of the features listed below under ""...likes..."", we found it much better than Cottages by the Sea because it was spacious, airy, well-lit, modern, very clean, had lots of hooks & hangers and places to put our bags and things, had two multi-speed fans in each room and had an immaculate, bright bathroom with high-end fixtures.See more",3.0,2018-02-28

Our room was delightful with a nice view of the park and the cathedral, everything was clean and comfortable. The hotel’s restaurant had amazing local dishes! It is conveniently located within a shopping center next to the hotel. Right outside of the hotel there are taxi services that are ready to take you anywhere you want but the hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of shopping areas and restaurants.

The staff makes you feel at home and treat you like a VIP all the time. In particular, there are three Valets, Cesar, William, and Mauricio, at the front desk that have gone above and beyond making me feel special, attending to any need that I have, and are extremely friendly. The hotel bar staff, Carol and Jennifer, are also friendly and attentive.
The hotel restaurant provides some of the best tasting food you can imagine. The breakfast buffet itself is incredible with a variety of breads, danishes, juices, hot and cold dishes, and you name it. I would also like to point out the Restaurant Captain, Darwin. He personally greets all the guests and has no problem bringing you coffee himself. He will go all out to make sure everyone has what they need.
I also want to mention that I was getting close the the end of my stay and my airlines contacted me to re-book for a later date due the a hurricane advisory on my return trip. I went to reservations and Belen was fantastic in making sure I could not only stay the extra days I needed but was able to keep me in the same room. I really appreciate Belen's efforts.
