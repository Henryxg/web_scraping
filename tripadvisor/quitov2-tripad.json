Hotel la Basilica proved to be a wonderful place to stage our brief stay in Quito. Senora Mirian is wonderfully kind, as is everyone we got to know who works for her. Josue, who runs the desk, is an excellent host and was always eager to help us. The rooms are all great\u2014comfortable and inviting.

Its located on a central street right in the historic district of Quito. So there are a LOT of churches, museums and restaurants within walking distance.   (2) Almost immediately upon booking, I received a message from Mr. Byron confirming my stay and offering to arrange door-to-door transportation from the airport to the hotel. Such a helpful service.  (3) I arrived later than expected and Mrs. Mirian (owner) graciously and enthusiastically greeted me at the door of the hotel upon arrival. I received a personal tour of the hotel on the same night of arrival and even visited the rooftop area to view the city at night and have my picture taken by Mrs. Mirian.  (4) The entire hotel is immaculate. The young lady who cleaned my room each day was beyond thorough. Literally, the floors glistened and not a single speck of dust/dirt/debris could be found after she finished. I even caught her scrubbing down the front door entrance to the hotel one morning.  (5) I was greeted each and every morning by Ms. Mirian, her husband or Josu\u00e9 before leaving the hotel for my tours (even at 6am)! The owners and staff are incredibly attentive and inviting. And you can sense the genuineness of their warmth.   (6) A hearty breakfast is prepared every morning and served in the courtyard. Its included in the price and usually consists of fresh juice, eggs to order, bread, a variety of fruit and great coffee.  (7) Amenities: The hotel offers laundry services, tour assistance and a quant cellar if you\u2019re in need of local wine during your stay. The electrical outlets in the rooms are well-positioned. There is a small safe in the room (not quite large enough for laptop or larger items but more than sufficient).   (8) Security is important to me as a frequent solo female  traveler. The main entrance leads directly from the street and has double lock & bolt. Each boutique room has its own lock. You receive a key to the front entrance and a key to your private room upon check-in. There are cameras (not obtrusive) everywhere and someone to greet you each time you enter or exit. So I felt more than safe staying there.   Without reservation, I not only recommend this hotel but I will definitely stay again on my return trip to Quito.

From the start, he too was there for us if ever needed. Again, as with Hernan and Johnny, Joel was sincere and very pleasant to converse with. We also took a tour to the Middle of the Earth, local markets and restaurants and the Quito Teleferico. This tour was hosted by Joel, while he was an employee you felt like he was a friend.

I cannot understand why this place is highly rated. I've traveled extensively and cannot think of another experience which compares. I have NEVER felt this unsafe.  I felt unsafe with and bullied by Mauri. On our first ride together (alone), dogs attacked my horse (not barked at, ATTACKED). He never even turned around to look at me, let alone attempt to assist me in any way. When I regained control of my frightened, kicking horse and evaded the dogs, I told him I felt unsafe with him and wanted to return to the Hacienda. He didn't want to. \u201dThey\u2019re dogs,\u201d he said, \u201cwhat do you want me to do about it?\u201d In that moment, I decided to cut my stay short. I insisted we return to the Hacienda. We were 20 min into our ride. I asked if we were returning every 15-20 min, for an hour. \"Do you feel better now?\" He asked after almost an hour and a half. I suspect he ignored my request to return hoping I'd forget the incident. This made me so uncomfortable.  At the Hacienda, I told Mauri I planned to leave within the next few days. He angrily demanded to know why - though I\u2019d already told him \u2014 and dismissively waved his hands in my face when I responded.  Mauri seemed, multiple times over the course of that day and the following day, to \u201cforget\u201d I wanted to leave.  He claimed he called the taxi \u2014 I asked that afternoon and 4x the following day. When I asked for the final time, in the evening, he said \"so you're REALLY leaving?\"  I said yes. He said he had not received a response. \"What should we do if they don't respond?\" I asked. \"Yeah well I don't know,\" he said, and glared at me in silence. Luckily I found the phone number and sent a WhatsApp message; they responded in five minutes! I arranged the taxi myself. I am traveling alone; I was so disturbed by this. If I want to leave, the hotel is supposed to help me arrange transportation; I felt held hostage. I realize this sounds insane; it felt insane living it in the moment.  Backtracking: on my first day there, Mauri commented on my tattoos and told me I should \u201cstop getting them.\u201d He told me about another client \u2014 a tattooed American woman who got into the jacuzzi \u201cin a tiny little bikini so you could see everything.\u201d I thought this was inappropriate and it made me uncomfortable. I shrugged it off; I traveled so far to get here and had high hopes.  Mauri gave me three different horses in my 2 days of riding. The first reared when spooking. Another bolted in the paddock and bucked several times when I slowed him. I was told \u201cthese are horses for experienced riders\u201d in a tone that implied I somehow asked for this by saying I was experienced, and should \u201chandle it.\u201d I did, but this was jarring and not the experience I wanted or expected when I booked my trip here.  No one ever assessed my riding ability.  On my second day, I witnessed a small child fall off her horse and almost get trampled. Mauri blamed her for \u201cnot controlling her horse\u201d (she was 8 and a first time rider) and then laughed.  Gabriel called me on my last morning to ask why I was leaving. I told him I felt unsafe with Mauri's behavior and comments. He said \u201cyeah well he (Mauri) is getting old.\u201d  I would not recommend this location. Bucking and rearing horses are not \u201cadvanced\u201d horses, they\u2019re liabilities. The good horse I rode, Moonshine, was bitless because of a bad tooth \u2014 this calls for vet care. I saw another horse with a badly infected leg. One of the employees told me the lame horses were given to children.  All the trails at Alegria are on cobbled roads \u2014 and so is 90% of the cantering \u2014 unsafe for rider and bad for the horse.\u2026", "p_fecha_comen": "2022-04-01", "p_puntuacion": 1, "p_pais_de_origen": "Brooklyn, New York", "p_n_contributions": 3.0, "p_date_stay": ""}, {"nombreh_id": "Hacienda La Alegria", "p_comentario": "Traveling isn\u2019t always such a rewarding experience.

The first day you ride out to the premises around the Hacienda to pep up your ride abilities and of course to test if the horse and the saddle you are using are the right ones. In the afternoon you are asked to join to get to know the Hacienda, so you watch the cow milking process, you visit the mares and their ponies and you enjoy the tranquil surroundings. Food at La Alegria is delicious and Patty makes sure to look out for all your dietary requirements. The riding adventure started the next day. It was a real extraordinary experience. Gabriel and his wonderful team, including the patient and wonderful horses took us through a route where we could enjoy the espectacular scenery that started at 2800 mts over the mountains  to a 3500 mts pass and then slowly descended to a totally different biosphere where giant farms, luscious plants and trees and thousands of orchids.

I chose to stay at NH Collection because I had stayed in several other of their hotels in different countries mainly in Europe. But this NH Collection Quito Royal exceeded any and all of my expectations!!   From the moment I arrived, the welcome I received was unmatched. After helping me settle in my suite, they took time to help me figure out what all I need to see and do. Yanira at the front desk was extremely helpful daily with any and all my many questions and requests.   I had forgotten my phone charger and Geovanny, also at the front desk offered me his personal charger for the duration of my stay. Although later on the hotel was able to provide me with one as well. Whenever I called Uber, Geovanny, Robert (Security) as well as Miguel all took time to jot down the license plate and speak with each driver briefly. If I wasn\u2019t taking Uber, they were swift in arranging a hotel transportation for me anytime I needed one. They made me feel extremely protected and safe.   Everyday Paulina took extreme care in cleaning my Suite and replenishing anything I needed. Each day I come back it was as though the room hadn\u2019t been used. Everything was squeaky clean!   I also met Carlos, the hotel director who introduced himself and asked me if everything was to my liking. Which of course more than that, as everything had exceeded my expectations. Carlos took great care in translating for me whenever I needed help communicating with a couple vendors over the phone. He also made excellent restaurant recommendations for me as well as taking time making reservations for me. I was so pleasantly surprised to also receive wine and cheese spread sent to my suite one of the days. And because of a late flight, I was also granted a late checkout which I truly appreciate.   This hotel is run extremely well and seamlessly. I travel all over the world (Ecuador is my 54th country), and I wish everywhere I go they would have service as amazing as the one I received at NH Collection Quito!!!!

Dinner stops around 8pm, so get there early - I was glad we weren't late. We had some decent pizza and a bottle of wine that was nice enough.  My main reason for the mid-range score is this place isn't cheap, and the standard of the takeaway (we were leaving at 6am) breakfast was abysmal. Ordered one vegetarian and one normal. The veggie one had ham in.... and my non-veggie one was the cheapest white bread I've ever seen and the filling looked so cheap and nasty I threw it in the bin and bought a nice breakfast at the airport (top tip, domestic departures does a decent local style breakfast).

Some of our travel companions were in other rooms in the new wing -- Rooms 14-17. These rooms were not ready for guest stay. In full disclosure, our travel company made a last-minute booking due to demonstrations in Quito; however, this room would be considered uninhabitable by U.S. standards.   We were told that for service, we should send a message to the front desk using WhatsApp. That was difficult because the room had spotty wifi and mobile phone coverage was somewhat weak in the area.  For dinner one night, we chose room service. We learned that the link to the restaurant menu was not valid \u2013 the menu was different that night.

We were planning on staying in old town Quito as part of a tour, but the tour and original hotel reservation were cancelled due to street demonstrations by indigenous people in the highlands. San Jose de Puembo was lovely, with beautiful gardens and extremely clean. The room was spacious with a great view of the gardens and the mountains and city in the distance. Restaurant food was delicious and the staff were extremely nice and accommodating. There is a free shuttle to the airport which we reserved in order to get to the airport for out midnight flight.  Our first attempt to get to the airport was unsuccessful because all routes were blocked due to burning tires. Our shuttle driver tried multiple routes but we had to return to the hotel. The experience was beyond frightening to say the least.  Soon after, the driver informed us that another driver would try to get us to the airport by using a different backroads route. This time we were also accompanied by by a hotel restaurant waitress. Again, the driver tried multiple ways to get around roads blocked with burning tires. We finally got close to the airport and the driver went right up to a road block. The amazing waitress (who puts writing pens in her hair bun) got out of the van and negotiated with a group of protesters.  Then she and the driver shoved a roadwork plastic barrier enough to move burning tires out of the way for the van to pass. We got to the airport with 10 minutes to spare and made our flight. The driver and waitress were absolutely fantastic and courageous.  Upon exiting the shuttle bus at the airport the driver commented that we were likely never to return to Quito. I disagree. After the protests end around Quito I will most certainly return and stay at San Jose de Puembo to visit the city and surrounding areas.

No matter who I corresponded with regularly on email, chatted or spoke with, everyone was always friendly and helpful, and eager to assist with requests that went above and beyond - especially with very unique and challenging requests due to navigating travel during the Covid pandemic. The rooms at Hotel Patio Andaluz are neat and clean, and retain a unique charm unlike a big hotel chain. I stayed there 5 nights on the inbound, and then 2 days before traveling back to the US. The atrium is a beautiful, inviting dining area where we enjoyed many meals and lively group gatherings with good air circulation and spacing. In all my years of travel, I've never encountered more helpful, hard-working hotel staff who helped with a variety of needs including local recommendations on dining and transportation (which were excellent and a tremendous help for me in the early trip planning stages), sorting our Covid testing, luggage assistance at all hours, expedited and smooth check-ins...really the definition of consistent excellence in customer service in the hospitality industry. I cannot imagine a more perfect welcome upon arrival in Ecuador for anyone than a stay at Hotel Patio Andaluz! I am so grateful to have found it since it was an integral part of our successful trip.\u2026", "p_fecha_comen": "2022-02-01", "p_puntuacion": 5, "p_pais_de_origen": "", "p_n_contributions": 7.0, "p_date_stay": "2022-02-01"}, {"nombreh_id": "Hotel Patio Andaluz", "p_comentario": "Great location in the historic district within walking distance to all the cultural sites we wanted to see.

Luckily, she also had the good fortune to be quarantined at the Hosteria Rincon de Puembo during that time.  Let me begin by thanking  General Manage Jose Louis Granga and his staff at Hosteria Rincon de Puembo in Quito, Ecuador for their amazing efforts to assist her at a time when she was confined for more than a week in their hotel with Covid. Their gracious hospitality, combined with their vigilance in order to protect both her and the other guests in the hotel was amazing. This, in spite of the challenges of having a quarantined guest.  Not only did they care for her, they also took care to protect their other guests as well.  Hosteria Rincon de Puembo is a lovely oasis, with peaceful gardens and a lovely swimming pool (which sadly she couldn't take advantage of) combined with great food, that made a difficult time with a Covid quarantine much more pleasant. And Jose Louis epitomizes the best of a  Hosteria Director.  She was quarantined for 10 days this past January and Jose was her lifeline, both in providing the room and meal service, which was superb, as well as helping to arrange and provide medical service and travel assistance.  He and his staff did everything to make a bad situation better for her.  Jose arranged for a doctor, helped fill prescriptions and kept in contact on a daily basis either in person or by text.  He advised her when to make flight arrangements and organized transportation to the airport, always with kindness and a smile.  His staff and chef prepared great meals and excellent service, brought right to her room.  If I can recommend a vacation hotel while visiting Quito, Ecuador, it would be  Hosteria Rincon de Puembo.  My family and I hope to return to Quito in the future and stay again at  Hosteria Rincon de Puembo.

It\u2019s a pleasant enough place to stay, but was far outshone by our other hotels in Quito and beyond.  The Carlota was our final stay in Quito - if it had been the first, then my feelings about it may have been different.  As it was, the unappealing and expensive food, high cost of the airport transfer (getting on for double the going rate) and tiny room felt designed to satisfy new arrivals to Ecuador who don\u2019t yet know any better.  Those staff that we meet were friendly and helpful.  However, the front desk was often deserted, with no members of staff to be found anywhere.  Fortunately, the roof top bar seemed to be constantly manned, so we were never at risk of going thirsty.  The bar man was very welcoming and mixed some decent cocktails.  The hotel is well located for the sights of old town, although the congested road out front makes arriving by taxi an occasional chore.  Whilst a visually appealing space, the Carlota falls down on some of more basic qualities expected from a hotel in its price bracket.\u2026", "p_fecha_comen": "2022-10-24", "p_puntuacion": 3, "p_pais_de_origen": "Croydon, United Kingdom", "p_n_contributions": 226.0, "p_date_stay": "2022-08-01"}, {"nombreh_id": "Carlota", "p_comentario": "My husband and I tried to go to Carlota for Sunday brunch.

So we wondered around for a while and came back at 11. When we arrived at 11, the doors were still locked and after a while, the same receptionist came out and asked us if we had a reservation. We did not and she said they have a party of 18 and would be unable to seat us until 1pm. We were very frustrated that they could not accommodate anyone else besides the one party (even at the bar) and that she did not mention it previously when we came by the first time at 10am.

In fact this is a hotel we would love to return to.  We stayed here three times during our trip to Ecuador and the Galapagos, as we passed through Quito. The hotel is ideally situated in the heart of the historic centre and a short walk away from the main square and presidential palace. It\u2019s also a relatively safe place to walk from unlike some other hotels in the area.  What distinguishes this hotel was the absolute commitment of all of the staff to their guests. We encountered some difficulties with our onward travel arrangements, (absolutely nothing to do with the hotel) but these were sorted out by the hotel staff liaising with our travel agent. They literally made our holiday happen.  When we changed our plans at the very last minute, the chef (who had his coat on and was walking out the door) came back to cook us a lovely meal just for the two of us. He didn\u2019t need to do this but he said that he was a chef and it was his job.   Above all, the staff ensured we felt at home here. That\u2019s what a boutique hotel should do - recreate the feeling that you are among friends (especially when you are in a strange city far from home.)

You can barely tell its a place  to stay as it in the wall of other stores and you have to be buzzed in.    the front desk is to the left of this beautiful  open garden sitting area. The area is great to just chill out and have a drink.  The front desk sells beer for $2 and may of us stayed in this area after our dinner and just talked. The location is close to the beautiful  church and square but please be carefully after dark as its not safe.  The breakfest here is plain scrambled eggs, a breakfest roll, a slice of watermelon with coffee and tea. This unfortunately is pretty much the good of this place.  We had room # 1 omg. Its right of the front desk up the stairs first room to the left. The room felt very old and creepy. There is a big window door balcony thing but can't open to outside so its just a giant loud inconvenience.  As soon  as you step in hall its just lots of creaking noise and in room #1 the floor made even more noise walking  through. I understand old places have creaking old floors and  at first this wasn't terrible but it became nuts hearing people walk all night through the halls.   We had two full size  beds  in this room but one bed had hair all over under the covers yes I slept on top  of the sheets.  The bathroom  was not very clean either definitely  had mold in the shower and we didnt have soap just 2 small bottles of shampoo  but the worst part in this small bathroom there is a window that doesn't close fully and it is open to the stairwell. Yes we could see people walk up the stairs while we are in the bathroom. This to me  was the most distributing  thing. No safe in room either or hair dryer. I definitely  didn't  fall asleep here with  people yelling outside, sirens going off, sink dripping, cracking floors and dogs barking most of the night it was impossible  to fall asleep.   We were supposed  to stay another night after this night and return at the end of our trip but our travel group checked us out as many others in our group also had a terrible  experience.  This really isn't  a hotel but a nicer hostel  type place. If we were prepared for this type of place it be OK  but we just aren't  that type of traveler. We switched  to much better places.
