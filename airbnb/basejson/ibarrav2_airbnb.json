The apartment is on the 3rd floor of a storefront building (mostly medical and dental offices) and is accessed through a  main corridor. Very secure with security door separating the businesses from the apartment.  Aura lives across the hall and is an attentive host. We arrived on Sunday evening and the storefront was closed. The entrance from the sidewalk was a low door inside of the pull-down security panel. It was a little tricky to find when closed up so you will know what to look for if you arrive after business hours. Aura greeted us once we found the door. Great value with all you need for a pleasant stay!", "fechac": "2018-06-01"}, {"nombreh_id": "Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra", "comentario": "Not meant for Airbnb, but a great place to stay in Ibarra. It doesn't feel like an Airbnb, but more so a hotel apartment. Sofi wasn't around nor did she ever respond to me, only Aura. The communication face to face was great, but my messsages and questions asked via Airbnb were never answered. I would stay again, but not through Airbnb and not if I wanted any help or directions, the address is even wrong on the map function. Very sweet lady and genuine, I believe the method of how Airbnb works is just lost in communication. Clean and just as seen in pics!", "fechac": "2017-10-01"}, {"nombreh_id": "Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra", "comentario": "A totally cool apartment in a really great area! The apartment itself was very clean and we didn't miss anything at all. Check-in and communication were also great, we always got a direct response and found everything right away. If you are good on foot, it is easy to walk from the terminal, even with luggage. Less than 2 minutes away there is a supermarket, a really good ice cream shop and restaurants. In addition, there are 2 parks nearby and there are many small shops, cafes and co. A great place to stay for those who want to get to know Ibarra.", "fechac": "2022-05-01"}, {"nombreh_id": "Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra", "comentario": "It's a very central place, with many places to visit nearby.", "fechac": "2021-10-01"}, {"nombreh_id": "Paseo Bolivar 2, Ibarra", "comentario": "Sofi's apartment is comfortable.
