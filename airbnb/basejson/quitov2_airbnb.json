With that though, we had some issues that are easily fixable for future guests and also just plain bad luck on our part. I confirmed our arrival time to be between 2-4, and unfortunately when we arrived at 3:30 there was some repairs going on. No worries, we were able to store our bags in the room and then go grab some dinner after traveling down from the mountains. We came back from dinner around 5, and the workers were working on repairs. Unfortunately they didn't finish until about 6:30, which was late for us after such a long day. Again, unfortunate and I recognize this won't happen frequently and mostly out of their control.There might not be TP available, but there is a shop downstairs that might stock some(we brought some with).  Make sure to ask about the hot water heater upon check in. We struggled with it and a quick demo might help solve that issue for future bookings if you're unfamiliar.
