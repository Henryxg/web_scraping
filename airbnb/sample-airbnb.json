We stayed here for 5 weeks and felt like we had what we needed for the time. Oscar always responded very quickly when we had any questions.

We always felt safe (you need to swipe a fob to enter the building and to access all floors) and there is a guard at the door 24/7. This is the newer part of Quito as well. Lots of restaurants, a short walk to a HUGE grocery store (Megamaxi) and shopping mall. Bus stops right in front of the building!It was a little annoying to have to reserve everything (spa, pool, gym, etc) but that is the buildings rule with covid, not oscars issue:) you don\u2019t need a reservation for the rooftop! We spent a lot of time up there\u2026that\u2019s half the reason we chose this place and the views did not disappoint. The other thing we would have liked is some sort of guide left in the apartment\u2026how to use the washer/dryer (a learning process for sure), where the trash is located, checkout instructions, building rules etc. we had to bug Oscar for these items. Also, lots of scuffs on the walls and a few areas that could have used a deeper cleaning before we got there but overall it was clean. Also we had to supply hand towels for the bathrooms, hand soap, laundry detergent and a few kitchen items (since we were there so long). Would be nice to have one or two more bath towels.

Cons -The area is so-so. A couple of the Uber drivers warned us to be careful about going out at night.  But during our time there we never felt unsafe or saw anything shady.  But visually, the area is a little gritty.  -The apartment is not well stocked.  There were only 2 towels we had for the whole trip and there wasn\u2019t one for our baby.  There are no extra sheets, blankets, garbage bags, toilet paper, or paper towels.  There was a fresh water dispenser on the counter in the kitchen but it was empty so we had to buy water. -Like most people who probably book this place, we were drawn to the jacuzzi tub. Unfortunately we were never able to use it. Hot water and water pressure are an issue and it was extremely difficult to get enough hot water to use it.  I wrote in for help twice, and he kept saying it was working, but I don\u2019t know. One of the days, I was able to get it a little warm but that was the closest we got.  Our last night there we tried again and it ran ice cold water for over an hour so we gave up. That was really disappointing for us as it was what we were looking forward to.-The bedroom has a really nice glass roof/window.  While it\u2019s nice to look out, when the sun hits, it creates a greenhouse effect and can get very hot.  Also, condensation or something leaks down from the roof onto the floor and one of the beds and possibly your stuff depending on where you put it.-Other than the king bed and the TV stand, the furniture could be updated.-The apartment is five stories up and there is no elevator. But it wasn\u2019t too bad in my opinion.-The bathroom needs a towel rackPRO-It\u2019s near enough to many attractions -The TV is large and nice-The refrigerator is nice -The apartment is spacious -The price he is offering is very fair -The views are nice-The kitchen has a microwave -The place was clean-Good wifi -Plenty of closet and dresser access -If you cook, there are local fresh food markets immediately adjacent to the apartment with really friendly owners-Jamie is clearly trying to make it a good experience by adding all kinds of creative extras like a hammock, the nice TV, nice showers, and it appears he\u2019s working on installing a sauna.  If the water temperature/pressure, furniture, and greenhouse issues could be fixed, along with make sure there are more linens, trash bags, paper products, and filtered water available, this place would be very special.  But again, I think he is offering a fair price for the current situation.-Jaime is available by phone and is very responsive and willing to address any issues that arise and answer questions.

I waited for half an hour outside, the door wasn\u2019t answered, and then luckily another person in an Airbnb in the same building let me in and helped connect me to a lady that knew the host. The whole process was terrible, as she told me someone has already checked into the apartment earlier and I was left waiting for ages. The whole check in took over an hour  and a half to finally get into the apartment. I didn\u2019t get a sorry from the host. Next, the apartment is grubby - the sofa is filthy. The water also stopped working and so we couldn\u2019t shower, or use the hot tub which was the main reason we chose this place. I told the host and he sent me screen shot on the update of the water situation and said it was working, when it wasn\u2019t. Not happy with our stay.

Juan and Patty we\u2019re good with their communication but there were plenty of things that fell short and this place was not cozy by any means.  For starters, the bedsheets were itchy \u2014 clearly some cheap polyester\u2026 then the bathrooms did not have hand towels or liquid soap. There was one small bar soap and that\u2019s was it. There weren\u2019t any paper towels either. In terms of amenities, they all look cool but I wouldn\u2019t be able to review them because everything must be reserved. And don\u2019t think that you can reserve when you want / need them \u2014 you\u2019re not given an option, you\u2019re just given a time. And if you miss it and try to go an hour later, too bad. Hospitality wise for the building, the night people were nice and friendly but the morning front desk guy was straight up rude (he mansplained to me why I couldn\u2019t access the amenities without a reservation).

No. But I do hope the hosts act on some of this feedback because the place does have potential.", "fechac": "February 2022"}, {"comentario": "I will definitely come back to this place.
